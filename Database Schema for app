Designing a database schema for an online astrology consultation business involves identifying the key entities and their relationships. 
Below is a simplified example of a database schema for such a business. 
Please note that the actual schema may vary based on specific requirements and features.

Entities:

1. **User:**
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Password
   - Email
   - UserType (Client or Astrologer)
   - Other relevant user details (name, contact information, etc.)

2. **AstrologerProfile:**
   - AstrologerID (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing User.UserID)
   - Specialization
   - Experience
   - Certification
   - Availability schedule

3. **Consultation:**
   - ConsultationID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key referencing User.UserID)
   - AstrologerID (Foreign Key referencing AstrologerProfile.AstrologerID)
   - Date
   - Duration
   - Status (Scheduled, Completed, Canceled, etc.)
   - PaymentStatus (Paid, Unpaid)

4. **Payment:**
   - PaymentID (Primary Key)
   - ConsultationID (Foreign Key referencing Consultation.ConsultationID)
   - Amount
   - PaymentDate
   - PaymentStatus

5. **ChatMessages:**
   - MessageID (Primary Key)
   - ConsultationID (Foreign Key referencing Consultation.ConsultationID)
   - SenderID (Foreign Key referencing User.UserID)
   - ReceiverID (Foreign Key referencing User.UserID)
   - MessageType (Text, Image, etc.)
   - MessageContent
   - Timestamp

This schema includes the following relationships:

- Each user (whether a client or an astrologer) is identified by a unique UserID.
- AstrologerProfile is associated with the User table through the AstrologerID.
- Consultation table links users (client and astrologer) with a scheduled consultation. It references both the UserID and AstrologerID.
- Payment table links payments to a specific consultation using the ConsultationID.
- ChatMessages table keeps track of messages exchanged during consultations, linking them to the specific consultation and the users involved.

This is a basic schema, and depending on your business requirements, you may need to expand or modify it. 
For instance, you might want to include additional tables for user reviews, astrology categories, or more detailed user profiles. 
Always consider the specific features and functionalities your online astrology consultation platform will offer.
